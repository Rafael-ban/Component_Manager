# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
bump: patch

<!-- Add unreleased notes below this line. -->

- Removed the repository-pinned Android JDK path from `android-client/gradle.properties`
  so GitHub Actions and other non-Windows environments can use their own
  configured Java runtime.
- Added default-branch changelog release automation that syncs version files,
  pushes a release commit when needed, and creates the matching `v*` tag for
  `release.yml`.
- Fixed Windows MSIX install guidance and release packaging so the generated
  installer imports the test signing certificate into
  `Cert:\LocalMachine\TrustedPeople` instead of the current-user store.
- Restored the WinUI application resource merge so Windows startup and Visual
  Studio XAML Designer previews can resolve theme resources such as
  `TextFillColorSecondaryBrush`.
- Stabilized Android Compose Preview by moving preview rendering onto static
  string bundles and content-level preview composables instead of direct
  preview-time `R.string` resolution.
- Rebuilt the Windows WinUI shell around an inventory-first desktop workflow
  with `Inventory`, `Movements`, `Overview`, and `Settings`, plus denser
  list/detail pages, grouped sync settings, and refreshed XAML designer sample
  data.
